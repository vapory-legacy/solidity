Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript
and is designed to target the Vapory Virtual Machine (VVM).

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex
user-defined types among other features.

As you will see, it is possible to create contracts for voting,
crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.

.. note::
    The best way to try out Solidity right now is using
    `Remix <https://remix.vapory.org/>`_
    (it can take a while to load, please be patient).

Language Documentation
----------------------

On the next pages, we will first see a :ref:`simple smart contract <simple-smart-contract>` written
in Solidity followed by the basics about :ref:`blockchains <blockchain-basics>`
and the :ref:`Vapory Virtual Machine <the-vapory-virtual-machine>`.

The next section will explain several *features* of Solidity by giving
useful :ref:`example contracts <voting>`
Remember that you can always try out the contracts
`in your browser <https://remix.vapory.org>`_!

The last and most extensive section will cover all aspects of Solidity in depth.

If you still have questions, you can try searching or asking on the
`Vapory Stackexchange <https://vapory.stackexchange.com/>`_
site, or come to our `gitter channel <https://gitter.im/vapory/solidity/>`_.
Ideas for improving Solidity or this documentation are always welcome!
